This website will serve as personal repository of work examples and learnings. I will continually refactor and change technology to best represent my current capabilities and interests.

This website was designed in the browser and has gone through a few iterations before landing on an aesthetic. As a result, there may be some orphaned code that needs to be cleaned up. If you have any questions, please reach out!

Built with:
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/)
- Lil' bit of [D3](https://d3js.org/)

Face scan made possible by [Standard Cyborg](https://www.standardcyborg.com/)

Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

TODO:
- Add e2e tests now that design is mostly settled
- Write more blog content so that section can be released
- Migrate work examples and blog posts to Sanity CMS
